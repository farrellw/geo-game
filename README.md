Geography App

As a former teacher, many students--and yes, many adults too--struggle with spatial geography.  Understanding where countries and states are in the world is important.

This geography App combines use of the google maps api and a crud framework.  The app was built from scratch using ruby on sinatra.

Other technilogical proficiencies shown are active record validations, polymorphic associations, parsing csv files, local Environment variables to protect access tokens, and Model View Controller workflow.
